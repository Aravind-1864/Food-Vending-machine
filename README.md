# Food-Vending-machine
A simple Java program that simulates a Food Vending Machine.  It provides a menu of food items with prices, allows users to choose items,  enter quantities, calculates the total cost, and verifies payment.  Great beginner project for practicing Java basics like loops, switch-case, and Scanner input.
